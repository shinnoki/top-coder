Problem Statement

     Let A be a sequence of integers. We want to create this sequence as a
     concatenation of some (one or more) strictly increasing sequences. The
     LISNumber of A is the smallest number of strictly increasing sequences we
     need.

     For example, the LISNumber of the sequence A = {1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3} is 4,
     since A can be created as {1, 4} + {4} + {2, 6} + {3}, and there is no way
     to create A by concatenating 3 (or fewer) strictly increasing sequences.

     Another example: The LISNumber of the sequence B = {10, 20, 30} is 1,
     since B is already a strictly increasing sequence.

     Note that the optimal way of writing a sequence as a concatenation of some
     strictly increasing sequences is always unique.

     You are given a int[] seq. Return the LISNumber of the sequence seq.

Definition


     Class:            LISNumberDivTwo
     Method:           calculate
     Parameters:       int[]
     Returns:          int
     Method signature: int calculate(int[] seq)
     (be sure your method is public)

    

Constraints

  -  seq will contain between 1 and 50 elements, inclusive.
  -  Each element of seq will be between 1 and 50, inclusive.

Examples

 0)



       {1, 4, 4, 2, 6, 3}


    
       Returns: 4


     This is the example from the problem
     statement.


 1)



       {5, 8, 9, 12, 16, 32, 50}


    
       Returns: 1


     In this case, seq itself is already strictly increasing. Thus,
     the LISNumber of this sequence is 1.


 2)



       {1, 1, 9, 9, 2, 2, 3, 3}


    
       Returns: 6


     {1, 1, 9, 9, 2, 2, 3, 3} = {1} + {1, 9} + {9} + {2} + {2, 3} +
     {3}


 3)



       {50, 40, 30, 20, 10}

    

       Returns: 5




 4)



       {42}

    

       Returns: 1
